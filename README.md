# diageticui

Diagetic UI is a term that refers to 'in-world' UI, although it's slightly more complicated than that.

This mod aims to add some QoL to certain minecraft pain points. The only one it handles now is showing the inventories of shulker boxes that can't be opened.

I've broken my development goals into three phases:

1. Actually get something usable for my own gameplay
2. Make it actually 'diagetic'
3. Generalize the code so that diagetic UI can be rendered/written for more than a handful of use cases.

This is mostly a test mod that I'm using to get my feet with developing Minecraft mods. As such nothing is configurable, the code is ugly and unoptimized, and I don't even have CI. However, at the time of writing, phase one _is_ complete and does "work." The code cleaniness isn't great either. I will add more features as I feel like it. This is strictly a mod for personal use that I've made public because it might help others.
